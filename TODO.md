# TODO

- Change the main page to something more like REST resources
- Add link from show page to /watch/[video id]
- Add text to entries table? (band name)
- Ability to make groups
- Ability to add notes
- Add auth system and associate 'listened' with user.
- May need to store list of users that have listened in an array since we can't do joins
- Alternatively just switch to postgres
